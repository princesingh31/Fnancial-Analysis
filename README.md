#Financial Sales Performance Dashboard
Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive Financial Sales Dashboard built using Microsoft Power BI. The dashboard provides a high-level overview of sales performance, allowing stakeholders to track key performance indicators (KPIs), analyze trends, and gain actionable insights from sales data. It visualizes data across multiple dimensions, including time, geography, products, stores, and sales representatives, offering a 360-degree view of the business's financial health.

The dashboard is designed to be fully interactive, enabling users to filter and slice data to investigate specific areas of interest and make informed, data-driven decisions. The screenshot shows the dashboard filtered for the year 2020 and specifically for Store 5.

#Key Features & KPIs
The dashboard focuses on several critical metrics, which are prominently displayed at the top:
- Total Revenue: The total revenue generated for the selected period, standing at $5.01M.
- Average Revenue: The average revenue per transaction, calculated at $13.06K.
- Total Country: The total number of countries with sales transactions, which is 384.
- Total Transaction: The total count of individual sales transactions, also at 384.

#Dashboard Components & Visualizations
The dashboard is composed of several specialized charts and tables to provide detailed insights:
1.Total Revenue by Region (Donut Chart):
- Provides a quick percentage breakdown of revenue contribution from different regions (U.S.A., Asia, U.K.).
- In the current view, the U.S.A. is the top contributor with $2.44M (48.64%) of the total revenue.
2.Total Revenue and Average Revenue by Country and Region (Combo Chart):
- A dual-axis chart that displays total revenue (blue columns) and average revenue (purple line) for various countries, grouped by region. This helps in comparing performance across different markets.
3.Total Revenue by Quarter (Area Chart):
- Visualizes the revenue trend over the four quarters of the year, showing how sales fluctuate seasonally.
4.Total Revenue by Products and Store (Bar Chart):
- Breaks down the revenue for a selected store (Store 5 in this view) by product category (e.g., Smartphones, Tablets, Laptops). This helps in identifying top-performing products within a specific location.
5.Sales Reps Performance (Table):
- A detailed matrix that lists individual sales representatives, their total number of transactions, and the total revenue they generated. It includes a total row for an aggregated view.
6.Total Revenue and Average Revenue by Month and Region (Combo Chart):
- A granular view of performance, showing total revenue (columns) and average revenue (line) on a month-by-month basis, with a color-coded breakdown by region.
7.Total Revenue by Store (Bar Chart):
- A simple bar chart that seems to highlight the revenue for the currently selected store in the filter pane.

#Interactive Features
The dashboard is equipped with powerful interactive controls to enhance user experience and analysis:
* Slicers & Filters:
- Time Slicer: Users can filter the entire dashboard by Year and Quarter using the dropdown slicer on the top left.
- Rank/Store Slicer: A user-friendly button slicer allows for filtering all dashboard visuals to show data for a single store (e.g., Store 1, Store 2, etc.). The current view is filtered for Store 5.

* Cross-Filtering: The report is fully interactive. Clicking on a data point in any visual (e.g., a region in the donut chart or a month in the line chart) will dynamically filter and update all other visuals on the page.

#Technology Used
- Visualization Tool: Microsoft Power BI
- Data Modeling & Analysis: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was likely used to create the complex measures for KPIs like Total Revenue and Average Revenue.
- Data Transformation: Power Query was likely used for data cleaning, shaping, and transformation before loading it into the Power BI model.
